| About Me | 🎥 Our YouTube Channel – DevOpsWithUs |
| :--- | :--- |
| I’m learning Cloud Computing and DevOps by actually doing things—not just reading about them. I started with hands-on projects and certifications to build a solid base. <br><br> Right now, I’m working on real projects like CI/CD pipelines and AWS networking. I also share what I learn on my YouTube channel DevOpsWithUs, because it helps me learn better and maybe helps someone else too. <br><br> My goal is to become a DevOps Engineer who can automate things, work with cloud-native tools, and build systems that scale without breaking. <br><br> If you’re interested in DevOps or cloud, hope you find something useful here. | We run **[DevOpsWithUs](https://www.youtube.com/@DevOpsWithUs)** where we share what we’re learning in Cloud and DevOps. <br><br> I work on this with **[Tanvir Mulla](https://github.com/tanvirmulla11)**. <br><br> We post simple, practical videos like hands-on demos, small projects, and learning tips. <br><br> The idea is to learn in public and grow together with others who are on the same path. |
